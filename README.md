## Header Proyect (non-responsive)
---
This is a front-end practice project focused on building a **header and hero section** using **HTML**, **Sass**, and **Vite**.  
The design was created for **large screens (1800x1080)** and follows a clean, modern layout structure.

### Project Overview 🎨

Built from scratch without responsive design, optimized for desktop view (1800x1080).

Uses a structured Sass setup:

- `abstracts/` for variables and global settings
