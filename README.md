# 🧩 Header Projects (Non-Responsive)

This repository contains a collection of static header layouts built using **HTML**, **Sass**, and **Vite**.  
All designs are desktop-only (optimized for 1800x1080).

---

## 📂 Projects Included
- 🟢 **Coworking Space Header**

Each project is organized in its own folder, containing its own `index.html` and `Sass` structure.

---
## 💡 About
These layouts were created as part of my **Full Stack Developer Master’s program** to practice layout building, Sass architecture, and project organization.

---

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Add responsive versions using Sass mixins and breakpoints.  
- Expand the collection with more header designs.
